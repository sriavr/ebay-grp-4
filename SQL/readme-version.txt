Before making any change in the database, we should following below instructions:

1) Write about the change in this version log, 
and then assign a proper vesrion to it. If major changes then 1.0 becomes 2.0 etc. 
For minor changes 1.1 become 1.2 etc. 

2) The data contained in tables should also be made consistent with the latest change to the tables. 
For data see ebay-data.sql
Also you are required change the version inside the sql script file. 

DATABASE SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED PROPERLY AND DEVELOPER DISCIPLINE IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE.
